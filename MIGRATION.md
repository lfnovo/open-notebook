## ⚠️ Breaking Changes in v1.0

Open Notebook v1.0 introduces breaking changes that require manual migration. Please read this section carefully before upgrading.

### Docker Tag Changes

**The "latest" tag is now frozen** at the last Streamlit version. Starting with v1.0, we use versioned tags to prevent unexpected breaking changes:

- **`latest`** and **`latest-single`** → FROZEN at Streamlit version (will not update)
- **`v1-latest`** and **`v1-latest-single`** → NEW tags for v1.x releases (recommended)
- **`X.Y.Z`** and **`X.Y.Z-single`** → Specific version tags (unchanged)

**Why this change?**
The v1.0 release brings significant architectural changes (Streamlit → React/Next.js frontend). Freezing the "latest" tag prevents existing deployments from breaking unexpectedly, while the new "v1-latest" tag allows users to explicitly opt into the v1 architecture.

### Quick Migration for Docker Users

If you're currently using `latest` or `latest-single`, you need to:

1. **Update your docker-compose.yml or docker run command**:
   ```yaml
   # Before:
   image: lfnovo/open_notebook:latest-single

   # After (recommended):
   image: lfnovo/open_notebook:v1-latest-single
   ```

2. **Expose port 5055** for the API (required in v1):
   ```yaml
   ports:
     - "8502:8502"  # Frontend
     - "5055:5055"  # API (NEW - required)
   ```

3. **Verify API connectivity** after upgrade:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5055/api/config
   ```

### API Connectivity (Port 5055)

**Important:** v1.0 requires port 5055 to be exposed to your host machine so the frontend can communicate with the API.

**Auto-Detection:** The Next.js frontend automatically detects the API URL:
- If you access the frontend at `http://localhost:8502`, it uses `http://localhost:5055`
- If you access the frontend at `http://192.168.1.100:8502`, it uses `http://192.168.1.100:5055`
- If you access the frontend at `http://my-server:8502`, it uses `http://my-server:5055`

**Manual Override:** If auto-detection doesn't work (e.g., reverse proxy, complex networking), set the `API_URL` environment variable:

```bash
# Docker run example
docker run -d \
  --name open-notebook \
  -p 8502:8502 -p 5055:5055 \
  -e API_URL=http://my-custom-api:5055 \
  -v ./notebook_data:/app/data \
  -v ./surreal_data:/mydata \
  lfnovo/open_notebook:v1-latest-single
```

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml example
services:
  open_notebook:
    image: lfnovo/open_notebook:v1-latest-single
    ports:
      - "8502:8502"
      - "5055:5055"
    environment:
      - API_URL=http://my-custom-api:5055
    volumes:
      - ./notebook_data:/app/data
      - ./surreal_data:/mydata
```

### Health Check

Verify your API is accessible with:

```bash
# Local deployment
curl http://localhost:5055/api/config

# Remote deployment
curl http://your-server-ip:5055/api/config
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "apiUrl": "http://localhost:5055",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dbStatus": "connected"
}
```

### Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Frontend shows "Cannot connect to API" error
- **Check:** Is port 5055 exposed? Run `docker ps` and verify port mapping
- **Check:** Can you reach the API? Run `curl http://localhost:5055/api/config`
- **Solution:** If using custom networking, set `API_URL` environment variable

**Problem:** Auto-detection uses wrong hostname
- **Example:** Frontend at `http://internal-hostname:8502` but API should use `http://public-hostname:5055`
- **Solution:** Set `API_URL=http://public-hostname:5055` environment variable

**Problem:** Still running the old Streamlit version after `docker pull`
- **Check:** Are you using the "latest" tag? It's frozen at Streamlit version
- **Solution:** Update to `v1-latest` or `v1-latest-single` tag

- **Data format**: No data migration needed
- **Configuration**: Same environment variables
- **Docker deployment**: Same ports and setup

## Migration Paths

### Path 1: Docker Users (Recommended)

If you're running Open Notebook via Docker, migration is automatic:

1. **Stop the current version**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. **Update to the latest image**:
   ```bash
   # Update docker-compose.yml to use v1-latest
   # Change from:
   image: lfnovo/open_notebook:latest-single
   # To:
   image: lfnovo/open_notebook:v1-latest-single
   ```

3. **Start the new version**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose pull
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the new frontend**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:8502 (new React UI)
   - API Docs: http://localhost:5055/docs

**Your data is automatically preserved!** All notebooks, sources, and notes carry over seamlessly.

### Path 2: Source Code Users

If you're running from source code:

1. **Pull the latest code**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Update Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

4. **Start services** (3 terminals):
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Database
   make database

   # Terminal 2: API
   uv run python api/main.py

   # Terminal 3: Frontend (NEW)
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:8502
   - API: http://localhost:5055

## Breaking Changes

### Removed Features

The following Streamlit-specific features are no longer available:

- **Streamlit cache**: Replaced with React Query caching
- **Streamlit session state**: Replaced with React state management
- **Direct file access via Streamlit**: Use API endpoints instead

### Changed Navigation

Navigation paths have been simplified:

| Old Path | New Path |
|----------|----------|
| Settings → Models | Models |
| Settings → Advanced | Advanced |
| Other paths | (Same but cleaner navigation) |

### API Changes

**No breaking API changes!** The REST API remains fully backward compatible.

## New Features in React Version

The React frontend brings several improvements:

### Performance
- **Faster page loads**: Client-side rendering with React
- **Better caching**: React Query for intelligent data caching
- **Optimized builds**: Next.js automatic code splitting

### User Experience
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional interface with shadcn/ui

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't access the frontend

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if services are running
docker-compose ps

# Check logs
docker-compose logs open_notebook

# Restart services
docker-compose restart
```

### Issue: API errors in new frontend

**Solution**:
The new frontend requires the API to be running. Ensure:
```bash
# API should be accessible at
curl http://localhost:5055/health

# If not, check API logs
docker-compose logs open_notebook | grep api
```

### Issue: Missing data after migration

**Solution**:
Data is preserved automatically. If you don't see your data:

1. Check database volume is mounted correctly:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   # Verify volumes in docker-compose.yml:
   # - ./surreal_data:/mydata  (for multi-container)
   # - ./surreal_single_data:/mydata (for single-container)
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Check SurrealDB is running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs surrealdb
   ```

### Issue: Port conflicts

**Solution**:
If ports 8502 or 5055 are already in use:

```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :8502
lsof -i :5055

# Stop conflicting service or change Open Notebook ports
# Edit docker-compose.yml:
ports:
  - "8503:8502"  # Change external port
  - "5056:5055"  # Change external port
```

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to roll back to the Streamlit version:

### Docker Users

```bash
# Stop current version
docker-compose down

# Edit docker-compose.yml to use old image
# Change to: lfnovo/open_notebook:streamlit-latest

# Start old version
docker-compose up -d
```

### Source Code Users

```bash
# Checkout the last Streamlit version tag
git checkout tags/streamlit-final

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Start Streamlit
uv run streamlit run app_home.py
```

## FAQs

### Will my notebooks and data be lost?
No! All data is preserved. The database and API backend are unchanged.

### Do I need to update my API integrations?
No! The REST API remains fully backward compatible.

### Can I use both frontends simultaneously?
Technically yes, but not recommended. Choose one for consistency.

### What about my custom Streamlit pages?
Custom Streamlit pages won't work with the React frontend. Consider:
- Using the REST API to build custom integrations
